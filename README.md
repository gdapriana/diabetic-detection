## Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects how your body turns food into energy. There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2.

* **Type 1 diabetes** is an autoimmune disease that causes your body to attack and destroy the cells in your pancreas that produce insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps your body use glucose for energy.
* **Type 2 diabetes** is the most common type of diabetes. It occurs when your body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin.

Early detection and treatment of diabetes are important for preventing serious health complications, such as heart disease, stroke, blindness, and kidney failure.

## Technology

* **Python**
* **Streamlit**
* **Pandas**
* **Numpy**
* **Random Forest**
